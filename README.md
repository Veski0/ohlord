# Oh Lord, I have cried out unto thee.

# Section 1

**F**

Oh Lord, I have cried out unto thee.

Hear thou me.

Hear thou me, Oh Lord.

Oh Lord, I have cried out unto thee.

Hear thou me.

Give ear to the voice of my supplication.

**MF**

When I cry out unto Thee.

Hear though me Oh Lord.

**M**

Let my prayer be set forth before thee as the incense.

And the lifting up of my hands,

as the evening sacrifice.

Hear though me, Oh Lord.

# Section 2: A

**F**

Set a watch, Oh Lord, before my mouth and a protecting door about my lips.

**M**

Incline not my hear to evil words to make excuses in sins.

**F**

With men that work iniquity and I will not communicate with the choicest of them.

**M**

The just man shall correct me in mercy and shall reprove me,

but let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head.

**F**

For my prayer also shall still be against the things with which they are well pleased,

their judges falling upon the rock have been swallowed up.

**M**

They shall hear my words for they are sweet,

as when the thickness of the earth is broken up upon the ground,

their bones were scattered by the side of hell.

**F**

But to thee, Oh Lord, Lord are mine eyes,

in thee have I put my trust,

take not away my soul.

**M**

Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me,

and the traps of the workers of iniquity.

**F**

Let the wicked fall into their own nets while I alone escape.

**M**

I cried unto the Lord with my voice,

with my voice unto the Lord did I make my supplication.

**F**

I poured out my supplication before him,

I showed before him my troubles.

**M**

When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,

then though knewest my path.

**F**

In the way wherein I walked have they secretly laid a snare for me.

**M**

I looked on my right hand and beheld,

but there was no one that would know me.

Refuge failed me,

no-one cared for my soul.

# Section 2: B

**F**

I cried unto thee Oh Lord, I said though art my refuge and my portion in the land of living.

**M**

Attend unto my cry,

for I am brought very low.

**F**

Deliver me from my persecutors for they are stronger than I.

**M**

Bring my soul out of prison,

that I may praise thy name

**F**

The righteous shall wait for me until the recompense meet.

**M**

Out of the depths,

have I cried unto thee Oh Lord,

Lord hear my voice

**F**

Let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.

**M**

If thou, Oh Lord, should smirk iniquities,

Oh Lord who should stand?

But with thee there is forgiveness - that thou mayest be feared.

**F**

Because of thy name have I waited for thee, oh Lord,

my soul have waited upon thy word,

my soul have hoped in the Lord.

**M**

From the morning watch until night,

from the morning watch that Israel,

trust in the Lord.

**F**

For with the Lord there is mercy,

and with him is abundant redemption,

and he will deliver Israel from all his iniquities.

**M**

Praise the Lord all ye nations praise him all ye peoples

**F**

For his mercy is great towards us,

and the truth of the Lord endureth forever.

# Section 3: Doxology

**M**

Glory to the Father and to the Son,

and to the Holy Spirit.

Both now and ever,

and unto the ages of

ages amen.

# Section 4: Antiphon

**F**

Let us sing the praises of Mary,

the Virgin:

**F**

Door of Heaven

Glory of all of the world

Sprung forth from man

Who also didst bear the Lord

The song of the body lacks power

And the enriching of the faithful

for she revealed herself

as heaven

and the temple of the GodHead

She destroyed the bulwarks of enmity

and ushered in peace

and did throw open the kingdom

Wherefore in that we posses this confirmation of our faith

we have a defender

even the Lord who was born of her.

# Section 5

**MF**

be bold, therefore

be bold, ye people of God

for He thee oh powerful,

will vanquish all your enemies
